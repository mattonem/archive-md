# Mixed mushrooms and pearl barley with dried chilli, feta and fresh coriander

## Ingredients
Serves 4

A range of different mushrooms can be used in this dish.

* 200g portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 200g button mushrooms, sliced
* ½ tsp dried chilli
* ⅓ tsp cumin powder
* 2 small cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 small onion
* 40g feta cheese
* 1 large handful of fresh coriander
* 1 lemon, zest and juice
* 15g butter
* Sunflower or rapeseed oil
* 40g pearl barley

## Instructions

1. Put the pearl barley into boiling water and once it comes back to the boil, turn down to a simmer and leave until cooked (around 20-25 minutes).
2. Start by sweating a base of onions (sliced) and garlic in a frying pan with the butter and a drizzle of oil.
3. Add the dried chilli, cumin and some salt and pepper.
4. Once the onions have sweated off, remove them into a bowl and in the same pan (no need to clean it), turn up the heat and fry off the mushrooms on a high heat.
5. This should be done in small batches to avoid the mushrooms sweating in the pan.
6. Each time, a drizzle of oil can be added as well as some seasoning.
7. When the last batch of mushrooms is done, return the onions and fried mushrooms to the pan for less than a minute on a low heat and combine all together to allow the flavors to infuse.
8. Chop some of the fresh coriander and mix through the mushrooms with the pearl barley and add a dash of the lemon juice as well.
9. Keep a few of the leaves for garnish.
10. Plate with sliced feta, fresh coriander and some lemon zest.
