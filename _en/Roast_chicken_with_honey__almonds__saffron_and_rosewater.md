# Roast chicken with honey, almonds, saffron and rosewater

This recipe is sourced from Ottolenghi in London.

## Ingredients

Serves 4

* 1 chicken, divided or quartered (or 2 breast and 2 leg pieces, skin on)
* 1 white onion, sliced lengthwise
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 8 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
* 1 tsp saffron strands
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tsp Maldon sea salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 2 tsp rosewater
* 5 tbsp honey
* 100g flaked almonds

## Instructions

1. Score the leg and breast pieces through the skin, and dry well.
2. Mix all the marinade ingredients together and rub well into the chicken pieces, making sure to place the saffron strands directly onto the flesh.
3. Leave in the fridge to marinate overnight, or for a minimum of 2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
5. Place the marinated chicken pieces, along with the onions, onto a baking tray skin side up, and with plenty of space around the pieces.
6. Roast for 25-30 mins, until cooked through.
7. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the flaked almonds, honey and rosewater and place a spoonful of each onto each piece of chicken.
8. Return to the oven and roast for a further few minutes, until the nuts have coloured.
9. Leave to rest before serving on either a platter with fresh herbs, or on individual plates.
