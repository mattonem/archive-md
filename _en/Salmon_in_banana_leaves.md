# Salmon in banana leaves

## Ingredients

* 6 pin-boned, skinless salmon fillets, 150-175g each, centre cut
* 6 banana leaves, each about 30cm square
* 2 spring onions

### Marinade

* 80ml sesame oil
* 1 small red chilli, seeded and finely chopped
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp grated ginger

## Instructions

### Marinade

1. Whisk the ingredients in a small bowl. Coat the fillets all over. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour.
2. Rinse the banana leaves under cool water, then carefully wipe them clean with damp kitchen paper.

### Cooking

1. Set up the grill for direct grilling, moderate heat (180Â°C+). When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill.
2. Parcels: Remove the excess marinade from the fillets, then discard the marinade and place each fillet in the centre of a banana leaf. Place some spring onions on top. Fold the leaf over to completely enclose the fillet and make a packet. Secure with a cocktail stick, being careful not to pierce the fish. Brush each packet on both sides with water.
3. Grill the packets over direct medium heat for 8-10 minutes, with the lid closed as much as possible, turning the packet once, until the leaves are blackened in some parts. If they begin to burn, move them to the indirect level of the grill. Check for doneness by opening the packet: the fish should be opaque with just a little pinkness in the centre.
