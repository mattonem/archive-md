- [250 ml coconut milk](https://www.asiamarket.ie/condiments-sauce/condiments/coconut-milk-cream.html)
- 3 Tbsp of sugar
- Â½ tsp of salt
- 2 fresh yellow mangoes (cut and diced)
- [50 g mung beans](https://www.asiamarket.ie/east-end-moong-whole-beans-mung-beans-500g.html) (sold as East End brand moong dal washed - split mung bean huskless)

## Method

1. Rinse and wash the glutinous rice a few times, so that the water runs clear.

2. Soak the rice in a bowl for 3 hours in water or you can also leave them overnight. The water should cover at least 2 inches above the rice.

3. Strain the rice through a sieve and place in a bamboo steamer lined with some greaseproof paper. Steam for 30 minutes or until the rice is cooked and soft. 

4. While the rice is steaming, in a small pan, gently heat the coconut milk with the sugar and salt for 2-3 minutes until the sugar is melted. 

5. Rinse the mung beans and add them to a small pot with enough water to cover them. Bring them to a gentle boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes until the beans are soft. Strain the mung beans and slightly pat them dry with a tea towel or kitchen paper. In a small frying pan, toast the mung beans gently for 4-5 minutes with a little oil until they are crispy.

6. Slice the mango flesh into cubes and set aside.

7. When the rice is soft and ready, spoon it into a bowl and pour two thirds of the coconut mixture in the rice and mix well.

8. On a plate, add some of the coconut rice with the mangoes and the reserved coconut mixture poured on top of the rice, sprinkle with some crispy mung bean. Ready to serve.
