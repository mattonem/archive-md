# Belgian waffle

~6-8 servings

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 187 grams milk
* 10 grams fresh yeast
* 187 grams beer or sparkling water
* 225 grams self-rising flour
* 10 grams vanilla sugar
* 30 grams sugar
* 75 grams liquid or melted butter
* A pinch of salt

## Step-by-step

1. Take 2 large mixing bowls and separate the two eggs. Put the egg whites aside for later. You need the yolks for the batter.
2. Beat the egg yolks with a whisk.
3. Next, add the milk and fresh yeast. The milk should be at room temperature. Beat with the whisk until the yeast is completely dissolved.
4. Pour the beer into the batter. It should be at room temperature. Give it a good stir.
5. Then sift the flour above the mixing bowl together with the sugar and vanilla sugar. Keep stirring with the whisk until the batter is lump-free.
6. Use liquid butter or melt butter in a pan at low temperature. Make sure it doesn't burn. If the butter turns brown, you have to start over again.
7. Add the liquid or melted butter to the batter. Meanwhile, keep stirring.
8. Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Then beat the egg whites until you have a stiff foam. Use a clean whisk for this and make sure that the mixing bowl is degreased beforehand.
9. Fold the whipped egg whites into the batter. Mix it very slowly so that as much air as possible remains in the batter.
10. Great! The batter is ready. Let it rest for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, turn on the waffle iron.
11. When the iron is very hot, you can start baking. Enjoy!
