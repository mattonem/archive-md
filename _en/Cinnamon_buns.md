* 55 g light brown sugar
* 45 g melted butter

### For Dough

* 60 g butter, melted and cooled
* 400 g strong flour
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tbsp caster sugar
* 7 g dried yeast or 15 g fresh yeast
* 250 ml milk
* Pinch of salt

---

### For Icing

* 60 g icing sugar

### For Decoration

* 150 g apple jelly or apricot jam
* 25 g pecan nuts

## Method

1. **Make the filling** by combining ingredients in a small saucepan and heat gently until butter melts. Cook 4–5 min until apple is soft, then remove from heat and allow to cool to spreadable consistency.
2. **Make the dough:** Combine flour, spices, sugar, and salt.
3. Add yeast to blood-temperature milk and melted butter, mix well until combined, then knead until soft and smooth (10 min). Oil a clean bowl, place dough in it, cover with cling film, and allow to double in size (about 1 hour).
4. When the dough has proved, knock it out onto a floured surface, roll out to approx. 45 cm × 25 cm. Spread the apple filling right to the edges.
5. Starting from one of the long sides, roll the dough into a tight sausage. Grease the bottom and sides of a 20 cm cake tin. Slice the dough into 8 evenly sized pieces, turn them so the swirl shows, and arrange evenly in the tin. Prove for 30 min.
6. Place in a hot oven and bake for 20–25 min until risen and golden.
7. While the rolls are baking, combine the icing ingredients and beat well until smooth. Spoon into a piping bag and set aside. Finely chop the pecan nuts and set aside.
8. Once baked, allow cinnamon rolls to cool for 5 minutes, then remove from the tin.
9. Heat apple jelly in a pan until melted, then brush over the tops of the buns to glaze.
10. Drizzle icing over the tops and sprinkle with pecans.
11. **Put the kettle on.**
