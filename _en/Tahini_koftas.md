# Tahini koftas

## Ingredients
Serves 4-6

* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 3 large onions, sliced
* 400g beef mince
* 400g lamb mince
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
* 15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1½ tsp ground allspice
* 15g pine nuts
* Salt and pepper

### For the tahini sauce

* 130g tahini paste
* 3 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 20g parsley, finely chopped, plus 1 tbsp extra for garnish
* ½ tsp cayenne pepper, plus extra for garnish

## Instructions

### For the koftas

1. Put a large sauté pan on medium heat.
2. Add two tablespoons of the oil and the onions, and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until light brown and caramelized.
3. Spread the onions over the base of a baking tray that will fit under your grill and set aside.

### For the sauce

1. Whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, cayenne, half a teaspoon of salt and 80ml cold water until smooth. It should have a thick pouring consistency, a bit like honey.
2. If it's too thick, add a little more water; if too runny, add a little extra tahini.
3. In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the two minces, garlic, parsley, allspice, a teaspoon and a half of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper.
4. Once well combined, form the mix into patties roughly 1.5 cm thick and 5-6 cm wide.
5. Put a large frying pan on medium heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil.
6. When hot, test one small bit of the mix and taste.
7. Re-adjust the seasoning if needs be.
8. Sear the patties in batches for about two minutes on each side until golden-brown and semi-cooked.
9. Place these on top of the onions, fitting them closely.
10. Spoon the tahini over the patties and scatter the pine nuts on top, followed by the parsley and a pinch of cayenne.
11. Put under a hot grill for three to five minutes, until the pine nuts and tahini turn golden and the tahini has a nice crust.
12. Remove from the grill, drizzle with more oil and serve hot with flatbread.
13. A simply dressed green salad would sit comfortably alongside this dish.
